           <h2> The best Fluffy Pancakes you'll ever eat.</h2>
       </p>
       <p> These Pancakes are the fluffiest of pancakes. They have been perfected over countless years by testing them in my own kitchen and on the hapless guests who end up there.</p>
       <P><h3>Ingredients</h3></P>
       <p>
           <ul>
               <li> ¾ cup milk</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
               <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
               <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
               <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
               <li>1 egg</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
       <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
       <p>
           <ol>
               <li>Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".</li>
               <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps are gone.</li>
               <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.</li>
           </ol>
